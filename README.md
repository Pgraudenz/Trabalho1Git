Pedrinho is a boy who loves family parties, especially Christmas, when he wins gifts from his parents and grandparents. This year, his father promised him a PS4, but only if Pedrinho could solve some challenges throughout the year, one of them, writing a program that calculates how many days are left until Christmas.

However, Pedrinho is only 9 years old and knows nothing about programming, but he knows that you, his cousin, mess with "computer stuff" and thus, he asked you to write the program for him. Not only that, but he promised to let you play every weekend and for how long you would like to.
